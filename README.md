# learningPytorch

This is a repository of all the projects I make using pytorch, while learning it.

All projects are made while following the video playlist of Aladdin Persson on Youtube.

I hope this pytorch code helps someone who is starting to learn like myself. 

All of this code is done in google colab, the corresponding jupyter notebook files and the python files are uploaded here
